## Technical details
- No previous experience with LLMs is required.
- `R` or `python` programming knowledge is desired but not required.
- In python we will use [`langchain`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/), in R we will use [`ellmer`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) to interact with LLM APIs.

## Preparation (API keys)
You will need an API key for the respective provider you plan to use.

- **Hugging Face Inference API:**
	1. Create an account at https://huggingface.co/.
	2. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens and create a new access token.

- **OpenAI:**
	1. Create an account at https://platform.openai.com/.
	2. Create an API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

- **Groq:**
	1. Create an account at https://console.groq.com/.
	2. Create an API key in the Groq console.

- **SURF AI Hub**:
	1. It is in pilot phase and requires an [application](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/222464732/Onboarding#Onboarding-Step1%3AShowinterest) and approval process to get access.
	2. Once you have access, you can create an API key at https://willma.surf.nl/.

Save your API keys in a safe place. The notebooks will prompt you to enter the keys at runtime.

## [Optional] Run Locally with uv and Python
If you plan to run the Python notebooks locally, we recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to set up a clean Python environment. You can also use `uv` to launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

1. Clone the repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/sodascience/sicss_llm_workshop.git`
	- `cd sicss_llm_workshop`
2. Create and sync the environment:
	- `uv venv`
	- `uv sync`
3. Start Jupyter:
	- `uv run jupyter lab`  (or `uv run jupyter notebook`)

If you use a different environment manager, make sure the dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are installed before running the notebooks.
